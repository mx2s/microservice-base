# sharpy-json 
Sharpy is a platform (back end json API) built on C# (mono) 
 
### Important (!) 
 
I'm just a junior developer, keep that in mind if you want to use this platform, or help me improve it, thanks! :). I see this platform as base / boilerplate for my side projects back end with needed features out of the box. 

### v0.4 Roadmap
- [ ] redis client for caching
- [ ] crypto API's manager -> checking wallet balances & transactions (Eth, Dash, BTC, LTC)
- [ ] coming soon
