# sharpy-json 
Sharpy is a platform (back end json API) built on C# (mono) 
 
### Important (!) 
 
I'm just a junior developer, keep that in mind if you want to use this platform, or help me improve it, thanks! :). I see this platform as base / boilerplate for my side projects back end with needed features out of the box. 

### v0.3 Roadmap
- [x] Controllers
- [x] Basic auth (login / logout / register)
- [x] Basic middleware (auth check)
- [x] Microservices (websocket sharp) communication
